# Bitcoin Exchange Arbitrage Analysis

This analysis looks at the price of Bitcoin on two different exchange, [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), for the first quarter of 2018. A day is selected for each month and the profits from arbitrage opportunities are evaluated to determine the viability of the trading strategy.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). The analysis is carried out in a [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook.
